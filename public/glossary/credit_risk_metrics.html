<p><b>Net Present Value (NPV)</b> – current spot value of a transaction.</p>

<p><b>Current Exposure (CE)</b> – only the positive portion of NPVs across a given set of
transactions, reflecting the amount by which the counterparty may owe you if
trades were immediately cancelled.</p>

<p><b>Effective Expected Positive Exposure (EEPE)</b> – the time-weighted average of the
running maximum EPE over the first year of the transaction.</p>

<p><b>Total Exposure</b> – CE plus EEPE, a combination of actual (CE) and simulated
future exposure (EEPE)</p>

<p><b>Expected Positive Exposure (EPE)</b> – at a given point in time of simulated
exposure, the average of all positive values across the NPV distribution.</p>

<p><b>Expected Negative Exposure (ENE)</b> – at a given point in time of simulated
exposure, the average of all negative values across the NPV distribution.</p>

<p><b>Potential Future Exposure (PFE)</b> – at a given point in time of simulated
exposure, a user-defined positive quantile across the NPV distribution.</p>
