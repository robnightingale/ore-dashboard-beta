<p><b>1. Credit value adjustment (CVA)</b> Although counterparties generally exchange
margin or collateral in a derivatives trade to mitigate outstanding exposure,
credit risk will never be entirely removed because continuous collateral
monitoring is operationally impossible CVA is the amount by which the actual
derivative price (credit risky) deviates from the price of the ideal, perfectly
collateralized, continuously margined derivative, and must be reﬂected in
derivatives’ valuations for accounting purposes</p>

<p><b>2. Funding value adjustment (FVA)</b> Derivative transactions bear a funding
cost/benefit for collateral posted/received: a counterparty with negative
mark-to-market must borrow funds at its unsecured borrowing rate to post
collateral to the opposite counterparty FVA is a measure of the expected
funding cost over the life of the trade and measures the asymmetry between a
counterparty’s unique funding cost and the common interest rate specified by
the collateral agreement</p>

<p><b>3. Collateral value adjustment (ColVA)</b> Reflects the difference between the
expected return on collateral and the risk-free rate (generally overnight
indexed swap, or OIS) specified in the collateral agreement</p>
